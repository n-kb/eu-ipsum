## What's this?

Just a generator of random and senseless sentences. Any resemblance to real and actual reports to or by the European Commission is purely coincidental.

## How did you do it?

I randomly picked 20 reports from the website of the European Commission and did a words frequency analysis on them. I then coded a generator that uses the most common words and reorganizes them in neat paragraphs.
